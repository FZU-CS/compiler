This repository maintains the coding tasks of "Compiler Principles", FZU, 2017 Fall. 

Introduction: 
  The basic of this repository is a compiler for Pascal language. We make some efforts on accommodating to the additional requirements of this experiment, including:

Lexer: 
  * 1.Analysing specific integer number, such as Oct, Bin, Hex.
  * 2.Warning if an integer is bigger than 2^31;
  * 3.Analysing type "string".

Grammatical Analysis: TBD

IR Generating: TBD

Any issues:
