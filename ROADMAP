ROADMAP


Running Lexer: ./run_lexer.py path/to/pascal/program

eg. ./run_lexer.py lexer_tests/helloworld.pas


Running SLR(1)-based Parser: ./run_parser_demo.sh

This command would first generate a folder named build. And then
the procedure would feed the executable file "parser" with the 
input tocken file, i.e.parser_tests/standard_input.txt in our demo.

We have not combined the C++ parser and Python lexer yet. Welcome to
submit a PR to implement it.
